# multi-controlled_unitary_gates
In this repo, we construct multi-controlled gates using only cx and single-qubit gates.

-mention Nelson-Chuang figs.
-explain implementationsfor small number of controlled qubits based on transpile function usage.

Towards the end, we implement a multicontrolled unitary gate based on page 18 of 'Elementary gates for quantum computation' by Barenco et al, which uses only one ancilla in exchange of an exponential increase in the number of gates required.
